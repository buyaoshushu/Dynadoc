## Introduction

This is not your father's documentation generator. Dynadoc creates interactive docs for your Clojure/ClojureScript project and all of its dependencies *dynamically*. It's meant to be a general dev tool, not just a static generator for library authors.

From a browser-based UI, you can see any function's docstring, source code, spec, and a little web editor where you can play with it. You can even annotate your own functions with code examples for Dynadoc to include -- an elegant improvement over shoving them in docstrings.

See [the website](https://sekao.net/dynadoc/) for instructions on how to use it.
